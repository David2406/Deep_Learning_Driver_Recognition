# Deep_Learning_Driver_Recognition
A deep learning project inspired from the Kaggle competition: "Distracted Driver Detection"

This repository contains a notebook 'Driver_Recognition.ipynb' in which different deep learning developpments are implemented 
in order to detect 10 classes of driver behaviors. The presentation of the problem and the construction of the data sets are 
described in the notebook itself.

This repository also contains the zipped folder train.zip which contains 20000 .jpeg images of different drivers. 
Before executing the notebook, you should unzip train.zip as the path towards the folder ./train/ is required to build the dataset.
